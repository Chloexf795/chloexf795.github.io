        <h3>What we want to make?</h3>
        <p>A plugin to help users learn a second language while browsing websites.</p>

        <!-- Image -->
        <img src="assets/images/Low-fidelity Figma Prototype.jpg" alt="Low-fidelity prototype of WebLinguo plugin" class="img-fluid my-3" style="max-width: 80%; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;">

        <!-- Explanation -->
        <p>This prototype addresses user needs by integrating language learning into daily browsing. It enables contextual translation, vocabulary tracking, and pop-up quizzes to enhance user engagement.</p>

        <!-- Subtitle: Three Requirements -->
        <h3>Three Requirements</h3>

        <p><strong>Remembering (History of Translated Words)</strong><br>
        The plugin will store a history of words that users have previously translated. This helps users retain new vocabulary by providing an easy way to review past translations.</p>

        <p><strong>Translation (Instant Word Meaning)</strong><br>
        Users can translate words from one language to another while browsing any website. This allows them to understand unfamiliar vocabulary in real time without disrupting their reading flow.</p>

        <p><strong>Quizzes (Active Learning Feature)</strong><br>
        The plugin will quiz users on previously searched words using multiple-choice. This encourages active recall, reinforcing learning beyond passive translation.</p>

        <!-- Subtitle: How my prototype addresses the requirements -->
        <h3>How My Prototype Addresses the Requirements?</h3>

        <p><strong>Remembering (History Feature)</strong><br>
        As shown in the third video, when users click on the history button, a pop-up appears displaying a table of previously searched words. It includes translations, the number of times a word was searched, whether the word was used in a quiz, and whether the user got it correct. This structured approach helps learners track their progress and review words they might have struggled with.</p>

        <p><strong>Translation (Search and Definition Popup)</strong><br>
        In the second video, the translation feature is visible at the top-right of the screen. User could search words there and the meaning and grammatical details will then appear. This makes it easy for users to get instant translations while keeping the website readable.</p>

        <p><strong>Quizzes (Randomized Pop-Ups)</strong><br>
        The fifth video shows the quiz feature, which randomly pops up to test users on previously translated words. The quiz presents multiple-choice questions with four options, reinforcing learning through recall and recognition. This method helps users actively engage with vocabulary rather than just passively consuming translations.</p>

        <!-- Video Section -->
        <h3>Prototype Demonstration</h3>

        <!-- Video 1: Switch On and Off -->
        <video controls class="video-preview" aria-label="Switching the WebLinguo plugin on and off.">
            <source src="assets/videos/Switch-On-and-Off.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
        <p>By clicking on the switch, users can toggle WebLinguo on and off.</p>

        <!-- Video 2: Translation -->
        <video controls class="video-preview" aria-label="Using the translation feature in WebLinguo.">
            <source src="assets/videos/Translation.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
        <p>This video shows how the translation feature works. Users simply type the words they want to translate in the top-right search bar. If they want to translate a sentence instead of just words, they could click the translation button at the bottom-left, and the translation window will pop-up as shown.</p>

        <!-- Video 3: History -->
        <video controls class="video-preview" aria-label="Accessing the history of translated words.">
            <source src="assets/videos/History.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
        <p>The history feature allows users to review words they have translated before. This helps in vocabulary retention and language practice.</p>

        <!-- Video 4: Settings -->
        <video controls class="video-preview" aria-label="Adjusting WebLinguo settings.">
            <source src="assets/videos/Settings.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
        <p>Once users click on the setting button, the setting window will pop up. Users can customize the plugin by their needs. For example, choose the language they use, set the frequency for quiz, and whether record the history by privacy.</p>

        <!-- Video 5: Quiz -->
        <video controls class="video-preview" aria-label="Taking a quiz on previously translated words.">
            <source src="assets/videos/Quiz.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
        <p>The quiz feature helps reinforce learning through active recall. The quiz is multiple-choice, and the users could press the button to choose the answer. If the answer they chose is wrong, it would flip as "X" and then flip back. If the answer they chose is correct, the correct answer will flip for a second for memory strengthening, and then it will jump to next word. After the whole quiz is finished, the final page would display, showing the overall accuracy rate. </p>

        <!-- UX Research Process -->
        <h3>UX Research Process</h3>
        <p>We conducted one-on-one interviews (3 Fictional Inquiry and 1 Semi-Structured) with users who were actively learning a new language. These interviews focused on their browsing habits, how they currently translate words, and their pain points in digital language learning.</p>

        <!-- Team Analysis -->
        <h3>Team Analysis</h3>
        <p>Our team used axial coding to analyze user feedback. We first used sticky notes to categorize pain points, feature requests, and usability concerns. Then, we grouped user insights based on major themes such as remembering translated words, instant translations, and interactive quizzes. This helped us prioritize features that users found most beneficial and refine our prototype accordingly.</p>

        <!-- Results from UX Evaluation -->
        <h3>Results from UX Evaluation</h3>

        <p><strong>What Worked Well:</strong></p>
        <ul>
